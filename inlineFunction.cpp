/*using inline function the compiler places a copy of the code of that function at each point
where the function is called at compile time.
Any change int to an inline function could require the function to recompiled because the compiler 
would need to replace all the code once again otherwise it will continue with the old funcitonality.

Syntax: inline return-type function-name(parameters)
{
    function body
}
